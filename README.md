# ML_CAR_DATASET
Car Price Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) This project implements a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model to predict car prices based on various features from the CarPrice_Assignment.csv dataset. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature encoding, scaling, model training, and evaluation.

## üìä ML\_TASK: Machine Learning Visualization Project

### üìù Description

This project demonstrates the use of various machine learning models applied on a dataset with comprehensive visualizations to help understand model behavior, performance comparison, and data characteristics. Visual tools such as **histograms**, **scatter plots**, **heatmaps**, **box plots**, and **accuracy comparison charts** are included for better insight.

### üöÄ Features

* Data loading and preprocessing using Pandas.
* Visual data exploration with:

  * Histograms
  * Count plots
  * Scatter plots
  * Box plots
  * Violin plots
  * Heatmaps
* Multiple machine learning models trained and evaluated.
* Comparative visualization of model accuracies.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

### üîç Models Used

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### üìà Results
